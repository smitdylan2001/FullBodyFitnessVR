Thank you for your interest in Full Body Tracking VR.

Since this is a pre release and not a stable version, please read through the following steps to ensure the best experience:

1. Make sure you are using the Pico Motion Trackers with the Pico 4 (Pico 3 might work, but is not tested)

2. Install the apk using adb or sidequest or your prefered method

3. (recommended, not required) clear room setup data if possible. The app works best if you set up the room after opening the app

4. Stand in an area where you have room to move. 
4.1 (optional) Stand in a place with 4+ meters of empty floor in front of you (to properly show shadow casting onto the ground in AR)

5. Open the app, while facing forward

6. Set up room if prompted (face forward when pressing 'back' to go into Full Body Fitness, as this will be your starting position and rotation)

7. Set up body tracking if prompted

8. Press the start button physically with your hands. If this does not work try both hands and wave them around a bit

9. Enjoy your workout!
